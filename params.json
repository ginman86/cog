{"name":"Cog","tagline":"cog is a cognitive psychology evaluator developed for use in the labs @ Oklahoma University.","body":"The main goal of cog is to provide a way to administer studies that is accessible, configurable and scalable. \r\n\r\n### Programs\r\ncog is designed to run off of programs. A program is a collection of question block/mode pairs. \r\nPrograms can be setup by the administrator to change the content of a study at any time.\r\n```\r\nday1:\r\n[\r\n   {\r\n      mode:  modes.study,\r\n      block: 2\r\n   },\r\n   {\r\n      mode:  modes.test,\r\n      block: 2\r\n   }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Local deployment\r\ncog is designed to be deployed locally with no communication to a server. This is ideal when dealing with the constraints of a scientific study. It is 100% self sufficient and interfaces with a local proxy that can easily be swapped out with server proxy if desired.\r\n\r\n### Questions?
